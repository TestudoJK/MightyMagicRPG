After defeating the goblins, you rush out of the cave into a whole new scenery of a large savannah. In the savannah you find a lot of creatures not like anything you had ever seen before. There were spiders the size of leopards and weird flaming snakes and lizards fighting over an oasis. Behind it all, you find a town with plenty of buildings and poeple. You decide that the town is the best place to go, but first you must get down from this large mountain. As you climb down, you notice a few flowers that are conversing and walking, and you're so mesmorized by the group that you nearly fall off of the cliff. Once you reach the bottom, you realize that there are a lot of angry animals across this savannah, and that you have a lot to get through.
