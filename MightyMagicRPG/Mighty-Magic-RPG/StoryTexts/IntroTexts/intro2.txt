The two goblins laugh in your face as you wake up. You are sitting in a chair with your hands tied behind by ducktape. You ask them, "What am I doing here?!". They laugh again and chatter to each other in a language that is most likely Goblinese, the taller one turns to you and explains, with a thick accent, "That mark on your arm means that you're a Mage of Might. Luckily, you're a newly born Mage, so you don't know how to use your magic. We, however, got those pixies to do our bidding and force you to make an action. We placed two goblins in each spot you could've ran. Now, you're here in our den, while we await to take you to our master." When he tells you about your mark, you get an idea. You think of nothing but flame, and run your hand over the mark. Suddenly, the tape lights aflame, and melts, freeing you from it's grasp. The goblins sit there in awe, but you throw a fireball at them, knocking them to the side. You run out of the room and into a corridor, where you meet three more goblins. You think for a moment, and guess that since you've already used fire and water spells, decide that nature must be next. You think of the large trees from the forest, and aim it at the goblins. A blast of pollen comes right at their faces, and they start to explode into a fit of sneezing. You rush to the exit, where the largest of all the goblins you've seen come into view. You decide that your only means of escape is fighting, so that's what'll you do, after you figure out your spells.
