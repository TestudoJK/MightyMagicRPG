You woke from your bed, or at least you thought you did... The first thing you notice is a mark on your arm. It looks like an infinity sign, but it wraps around in 8 different directions, like an atom. When you rub your hand over it, it glows up and fires a few bubbles. You table this problem and start to get up. When you finally view your surroundings, you realize that you're lying in an eerie forest, with sunlight barely trickling in through a thick, leavy canvas. There are constant whispers as you move around the area. Every once in a while you find an insect caught in a huge spider's web. There are a few rusty coins strewn about, and quite a few carts and wagons that looked like they had been looted. The trees lining the path are often hollowed in like there's a creature living inside, but everytime you check, it looks as if it had been abandoned for days. After you walk for a few minutes, you notice a few lights with wings fluttering around.
