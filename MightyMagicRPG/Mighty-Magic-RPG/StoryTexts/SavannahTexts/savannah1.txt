So, you're walking along the savannah path, and you notice a bunch of creatures that aren't from your world. It makes you think back to the main problem, what are you doing here? You suspect that you'll get a lot more information from the upcoming town, and that idea gives you a newfound energy to trek on through the savannah. You notice a lot of similarly colored creatures. There are lions with flaming manes and floating balls of fire. In the oases, a lot of the creatures that live in the water can move it and bend it at their will. The animals in the trees blast pollen at the creatures below, much like how you blasted the goblins back at the den. You note to yourself three types of creatures, Nature, Fire, and Water. This makes you wonder how many other types there are, and if you'll be able to use them for spells. Soon, you come across a three-way fork in the road, and you notice three very hostile creatures. To the right, there are flowers walking on their base leaves while they exude pollen and dust. In the middle, there are these weird floating spheres with flames surrounding their bodies. Every once in a while, a flame reaches out like a sun flare. To the left, there are blue frogs hopping around blowing bubbles out of their mouth.
